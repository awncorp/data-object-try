=head1 METHODS

This package implements the following methods:

=cut

=head2 call

  call(Str | CodeRef $arg) : Object

The call method takes a method name or coderef, registers it as the tryable
routine, and returns the object. When invoked, the callback will received an
C<invocant> if one was provided to the constructor, the default C<arguments> if
  is $result->[4], 4;
  is $result->[5], 5;
any were provided to the constructor, and whatever arguments were provided by
the invocant.
  is $result->[4], 4;
  is $result->[5], 5;

=item call example #1

  my $try = Data::Object::Try->new;

  $try->call(fun (@args) {

    return [@args];
  });

=back

=cut

=head2 callback

  callback(Str | CodeRef $arg) : CodeRef

The callback method takes a method name or coderef, and returns a coderef for
registration. If a coderef is provided this method is mostly a passthrough.

=item callback example #1

  my $try = Data::Object::Try->new;

  $try->callback(fun (@args) {

    return [@args];
  });

=back

=over 4

=item callback example #2

  package Example;

  use Moo;

  fun test(@args) {

    return [@args];
  }

  package main;

  my $try = Data::Object::Try->new(
    invocant => Example->new
  );

  $try->callback('test');

=back

=cut

=head2 catch

  catch(Str $isa, Str | CodeRef $arg) : Any

The catch method takes a package or ref name, and when triggered checks whether
the captured exception is of the type specified and if so executes the given
callback.

=over 4

=item catch example #1

  my $try = Data::Object::Try->new;

  $try->call(fun (@args) {

    die $try;
  });

  $try->catch('Data::Object::Try', fun (@args) {

    return [@args];
  });

=back

=cut

=head2 default

  default(Str | CodeRef $arg) : Object

The default method takes a method name or coderef and is triggered if no
C<catch> conditions match the exception thrown.

=over 4

=item default example #1

  my $try = Data::Object::Try->new;

  $try->call(fun (@args) {

    die $try;
  });

  $try->default(fun (@args) {

    return [@args];
  });

=back

=cut

=head2 execute

  execute(CodeRef $arg, Any @args) : Any

The execute method takes a coderef and executes it with any given arguments.
When invoked, the callback will received an C<invocant> if one was provided to
the constructor, the default C<arguments> if any were provided to the
constructor, and whatever arguments were passed directly to this method.

=over 4

=item execute example #1

  my $try = Data::Object::Try->new(
    invocant => Example->new,
    arguments => [1,2,3]
  );

  $try->execute(fun (@args) {

    return [@args];
  });

=back

=cut

=head2 finally

  finally(Str | CodeRef $arg) : Object

The finally method takes a package or ref name and always executes the callback
after a try/catch operation. The return value is ignored. When invoked, the
callback will received an C<invocant> if one was provided to the constructor,
the default C<arguments> if any were provided to the constructor, and whatever
arguments were provided by the invocant.

=over 4

=item finally example #1

  my $try = Data::Object::Try->new(
    invocant => Example->new,
    arguments => [1,2,3]
  );

  $try->call(fun (@args) {

    return $try;
  });

  $try->finally(fun (@args) {

    $try->{'$finally'} = [@args];
  });

=back

=cut

=head2 maybe

  maybe() : Object

The maybe method registers a default C<catch> condition that returns falsy,
i.e. an empty string, if an exception is encountered.

=over 4

=item maybe example #1

  my $try = Data::Object::Try->new;

  $try->call(fun (@args) {

    die $try;
  });

  $try->maybe;

=back

=cut

=head2 no_catch

  no_catch() : Object

The no_catch method removes any configured catch conditions and returns the
object.

=over 4

=item no_catch example #1

  my $try = Data::Object::Try->new;

  $try->call(fun (@args) {

    die $try;
  });

  $try->catch('Data::Object::Try', fun (@args) {

    return [@args];
  });

  $try->no_catch;

=back

=cut

=head2 no_default

  no_default() : Object

The no_default method removes any configured default condition and returns the
object.

=over 4

=item no_default example #1

  my $try = Data::Object::Try->new;

  $try->call(fun (@args) {

    die $try;
  });

  $try->default(fun (@args) {

    return [@args];
  });

  $try->no_default;

=cut

=head2 no_finally

  no_finally() : Object

The no_finally method removes any configured finally condition and returns the
object.

=over 4

=item no_finally example #1

  my $try = Data::Object::Try->new(
    invocant => Example->new,
    arguments => [1,2,3]
  );

  $try->call(fun (@args) {

    return $try;
  });

  $try->finally(fun (@args) {

    $try->{'$finally'} = [@args];
  });

  $try->no_finally;

=back

=cut

=head2 no_try

  no_try() : Object

The no_try method removes any configured C<try> operation and returns the
object.

=over 4

=item no_try example #1

  my $try = Data::Object::Try->new;

  $try->call(fun (@args) {

    return [@args];
  });

  $try->no_try;

=back

=cut

=head2 result

  result(Any @args) : Any

The result method executes the try/catch/default/finally logic and returns
either 1) the return value from the successfully tried operation 2) the return
value from the successfully matched catch condition if an exception was thrown
3) the return value from the default catch condition if an exception was thrown
and no catch condition matched. When invoked, the C<try> and C<finally>
callbacks will received an C<invocant> if one was provided to the constructor,
the default C<arguments> if any were provided to the constructor, and whatever
arguments were passed directly to this method.

  my $try = Data::Object::Try->new;

  $try->call(fun (@args) {

    return [@args];
